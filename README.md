# Favorite Products Example

The purpose of this Magento 2 module is to demonstrate how to add dynamic, 
customer specific data to a page that is stored in the full page cache according to current best practices (March 2017).

This module is **NOT intended for production**!

## Usage

This repository contains two versions of the module.

* The version marked with the git tag [**start**](https://github.com/Vinai/VinaiKopp-FavoriteProducts-Example/tree/start)
  is the module without dynamic content.
  This version simply uses a hardcoded list of favorite product SKUs.

* The version marked with the git tag [**complete**](https://github.com/Vinai/VinaiKopp-FavoriteProducts-Example/tree/complete)
  represents the module with
  proper hole punching logic in place.
